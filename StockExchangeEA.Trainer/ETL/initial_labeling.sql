--- initial_labeling.sql
--- Purpose: Generate investment rating labels (low/medium/high) 
---          for companies based on sector-level median financial indicators.
--- Input: raw_data table (imported from raw_data.csv)
--- Output: initial_labeling_data table

--- Step 1: Calculate medians per sector + cumulation period ---
WITH sector_medians AS (
    SELECT 
        sector,
        cumulation,
        PERCENTILE_CONT(0.5) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY net_income) AS med_net_income,
        PERCENTILE_CONT(0.5) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY net_cash_flow) AS med_net_cash_flow,
        PERCENTILE_CONT(0.5) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY roe) AS med_roe,
        PERCENTILE_CONT(0.5) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY roa) AS med_roa,
        PERCENTILE_CONT(0.5) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY ebitda) AS med_ebitda
    FROM raw_data
    GROUP BY sector, cumulation

--- Step 2: Calculate score for each company based on indicators above sector median ---

    SELECT
        d.id,
        d.sector,
        d.cumulation,

    FROM raw_data d
    JOIN sector_medians s 
      ON d.sector = s.sector 
     AND d.cumulation = s.cumulation

--- Step 3: Assign investment_level based on score ---
CREATE TABLE initial_labeling_data AS

        WHEN s.score <= 1 THEN 'low' 
        WHEN s.score <= 3 THEN 'medium'
