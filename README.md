# Stock-Exchange-Equity-Analytics-in-ML.NET

## Project Description
Developed an enterprise-grade evolution of the Stock-Exchange-Equity-Analytics system (https://github.com/JakubDadello/Stock-Exchange-Equity-Analytics.git) using C# and ML.NET to analyze financial data from 370 companies listed on the Warsaw Stock Exchange.

Built a machine learning pipeline that incorporates sector-specific features to classify companies into three investment ratings: Low, Medium, and High, supporting data-driven investment decision-making.

The project demonstrates both technical ML skills and financial domain knowledge, with universally applicable indicators such as ROA and EBITDA, making the methodology transferable to global financial markets.

### Key Features
1. Technology Shift: Transitioned from Python to the .NET 10 ecosystem for better performance and enterprise integration.

2. Advanced Modeling: Replaced Random Forest with LightGBM (Gradient Boosting Machine) to enhance predictive accuracy on complex financial tabular data.

3. Sector-Aware Intelligence: Models financial indicators (e.g., net_profit, ROA) while accounting for the unique nature of different industry sectors.

4. Investment Grading: Automated assignment of investment rating based on robust multi-class classification.

## Repository Structure
- `StockExchangeEA.Api/` - Model Serving & Inference: ASP.NET Core Web API providing real-time investment grading predictions via REST endpoints.
- `StockExchangeEA.Schemas` - Data Contracts: Shared Class Library containing strictly typed input/output models used across the entire solution. see [Schemas.cs](StockExchangeEA.Schemas/Schemas/Schemas.cs)
- `StockExchangeEA.Trainer/` - ML Pipeline: Console application dedicated to Data Preprocessing, LightGBM Model Training, and Evaluation. see [StockExchangeEA.Trainer/README.md](StockExchangeEA.Trainer/README.md)
- `CRISP-DM.md` - detailed methodology workflow

## How to Run

To run this project locally, you can use either Docker (recommended) or the .NET SDK.


## Tech Stack

- Language & Runtime: C# 13/ .NET 10 SDK
- Machine Learning Framework: ML.NET (Microsoft.ML)
- Data Preprocessing: LINQ, Microsoft.Data.Analysis
- API Framework: ASP.NET Core 
- Conterization & Deployment: Docker

Consistent with the research conducted in the Stock-Exchange-Equity-Analytics system (https://github.com/JakubDadello/Stock-Exchange-Equity-Analytics.git), this repository maintains the same data processing standards. The documentation aligns with the original project's structure but is adapted for the ML.NET ecosystem. Detailed process descriptions are available in [CRISP-DM.md](CRISP-DM.md).
